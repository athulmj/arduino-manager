Arduino Nano is a small, breadboard-friendly microcontroller board based on the **ATmega328P**. It offers the same functionality as the Arduino Uno but in a compact size, making it ideal for embedded projects, prototyping, and space-constrained applications. It supports digital and analog I/O, PWM, UART, I²C, and SPI communication, and can be programmed easily using the Arduino IDE via USB.

### Understanding Nano Pins

1. Digital Pins
- D0 – D13
- D0/D1 → Serial (USB communication)
2. Analog Pins
- A0 – A7
- A6 & A7 → Analog only
3. Power Pins
- 5V → regulated 5V output
- 3.3V → ~50mA max
- VIN → 7–12V input
- GND → Ground
